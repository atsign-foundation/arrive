# Contributing guidelines

We ðŸ’™ [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
for fixing issues or adding features. Thanks for your contribution!

Please read our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md), which is based on
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)


For small changes, especially documentation, you can simply use the "Edit" button
to update the Markdown file, and start the
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.
Use the preview tab in GitHub to make sure that it is properly
formatted before committing. Please use conventional commits and follow the semantic PR format as documented 
[here](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/.github/blob/trunk/atGitHub.md#semantic-prs).
A pull request will cause integration tests to run automatically, so please review
the results of the pipeline and correct any mistakes that are reported.

If you plan to contribute often or have a larger change to make, it is best to
setup an environment for contribution, which is what the rest of these guidelines
describe. The atsign-foundation GitHub organization's conventions and configurations are documented
[here](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/.github/blob/trunk/atGitHub.md).
