      "question": "What types of applications are in the works?",
      "answer":
          "@persona: Your go-to destination for building your online persona. As a starting point for all “@” apps, @persona allows you to set up your preferences and determine how you want to engage in the @universe.  @buzz: Keeping your social network up-to-date has never been easier. @buzz makes it possible for you to update your connections in real-time, at the same time. @mosphere: Transfer files in real-time across all devices and locations. @mosphere allows for peer-to-peer encrypted file sharing."

    {
      "question": "How are @pps different from what is available today?",
      "answer":
          "You’ll have total privacy and utmost control over your data while using an @pp. No one will ever spy on you or misuse your information. And since @pps use your @sign as a proxy for your digital identities, you won’t ever have to create a new username or password while using an @pp."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you let me know when new apps are available?",
      "answer":
          "Yes! When you sign up for your @sign, you’ll see a checkbox that gives us permission to notify you when we have new apps. Please make sure that box is checked if you want to stay updated. (You can also subscribe to our @news email to receive monthly updates!)Or join our developers announcement Google group to get updates on new, launching apps."
    },
    {
      "question": "If someone knows my @sign, can they see all my information?",
      "answer":
          "Anyone who looks up your @sign can only view the information that you’ve made public. Soon, we’ll be releasing @persona, an app that lets you set up and customize your public profile. You’ll have the freedom to adjust it as needed, and those changes will be viewable in a matter of seconds."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does an @sign cost?",
      "answer":
          "We believe that everyone has a right to privacy, which is why we’ve created the @sign-O-Matic, a free @sign generator. But for those who want to secure a more customized @sign, custom @signs are available for between \$10 and \$5,000 (or even more!), depending on your desired level of customization. For example, multiple words (i.e. your first name and last name) will cost \$100, single words will be \$1000 (because there are so few of these), and @signs with three characters will cost \$5000. Unfortunately, you cannot buy a trademarked name, since the rights belong to the owner of that trademark. And yes, you can customize with emojis!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I transfer/sell my @sign to someone else?",
      "answer":
          "Not at the moment, but we’re working on it! For now, if you want to transfer or sell your @sign to another party, please email us at transfer@atsign.com and we’ll help you figure it out.Once we’ve established a proper system to transfer and sell @signs, we anticipate that the value of @custom signs will increase. You’ll be able to charge more for any special @sign that you own."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do I have to do to renew my @sign?",
      "answer":
          "If you have a free @sign, you don’t need to worry about a thing. But if you have a paid @sign, you’ll need to renew it for \$10 each year. (We don’t store payment details, so we’ll let you know when it’s time to renew your @sign.) Instead of letting an @sign sit and collect dust, we want @signs not currently in use to be available to others."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I be able to use my @sign with my current apps?",
      "answer":
          "We expect that many of your current apps will transition over time, as more of their customers transition to the @protocol and away from applications that store their data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will there be @pps for businesses and corporations?",
      "answer":
          "Glad you asked! The Internet grew from communications to content to commerce – our vision is that all the 3 Cs will be enabled by @signs in the future. We are starting with core functional apps and will continue to expand rapidly as more developers and partners innovate with us."
